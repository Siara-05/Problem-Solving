<h2>🚀 Day 3 – JavaScript Problem Solving (Loops Practice)</h2>

Today’s focus was loops—for, while, and do...while—to handle repetitive tasks in JavaScript efficiently.
These problems helped strengthen my understanding of iteration and different loop behaviors.

📂 Problems Covered
<h3><b>1️⃣ Multiplication Table (multiplication-table.js)</b></h3>

<b>Problem:</b>
Take a number (e.g., 5) and print its multiplication table up to 10.
Format the output like:

5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
...


<b>My Approach:</b>

Used a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10.

Used template literals (`${}`) for clean formatting.

Added an alternative version using string concatenation (+) for beginners who aren’t familiar with template literals yet.

💡 Tip: Template literals make your code easier to read and avoid the hassle of adding multiple + signs.<hr>

<h3><b>2️⃣ Numbers from 1 to 20 (numbers_1to20.js)</b></h3>

<b>Problem:</b>
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 20.

<b>My Approach:</b>
Tried three different loops:

For loop – Best when the number of iterations is known.

While loop – Good when you don’t know exactly how many times it will run beforehand.

Do...while loop – Runs at least once, even if the condition is false. 

💡 Tip: Use do...while when you want the code to execute before checking the condition.

<h3><b>📌 Things I Learned Today</b> </h3>

The differences between for, while, and do...while loops.

Why template literals are cleaner than concatenation.

The importance of loop boundaries (avoid infinite loops!).

💡 Pro Tips for Anyone Trying This

Always double-check loop conditions to avoid infinite loops.

Use for loops for fixed iterations and while loops when the stop condition is dynamic.

Practice rewriting the same logic in multiple loop types—it strengthens your flexibility.

Experiment with different ranges (e.g., print from 50 to 70) to see if your loop logic still works.<hr>

<b>✅ Summary:</b>
Today, I worked on two problems focusing on loop logic.
The first problem polished my skills with repetitive tasks using for loops, and the second gave me practical experience with all three loop types in JavaScript.

🔥 Pro Tip: Take one problem and solve it in all three loop types—it’ll make you think differently about conditions and increments.
